# Rolling Game

[SimpleInput by Yasirkula](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnitySimpleInput) - used for the on-screen joysticks in the mobile version.

## Ideas for scoring/timing

- Survive as long as possible, time going down and pickups refresh the time
- Just scored based on the number of pickups gathered
