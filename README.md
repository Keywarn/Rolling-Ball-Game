# Game Jam 2020

A game made for the CSS GameJam 2020 at University of Bristol
Theme: Keep on moving forward
Inspired by Super Monkey Ball Target

All assets are mine with the exception of:

[SimpleInput by Yasirkula](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnitySimpleInput) - used for the on-screen joysticks in the mobile version.

Music was produced by my housemate, for this project, during the time-period of the gamejam
